# Module Assignment 3

You can use a UI library for the assignment but you can also just use unstyled HTML. The focus is on creating components so how it looks is not important.

Arrange your components in folders.

### WebPage contains:

-   Homepage with heading/homepagecontent components
-   NewsPage with heading/NewsList components
-   LoginPage with heading/Loginform components, validates UserName and Password

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
